# Degree Notes


This project was born with the intention of sharing university notes relating to university courses in Computer Science, Data Mining and Cyber Security.

I ask all those who want to contribute to clone the project locally and add your notes in an organized way or to link your repositories in this file, I will integrate it.

The goal is to create a single space where you can find all the material possible.
